# Changelog

## 0.2.1 (build 12)

- Preserve discovered Claude, Codex, and Cursor executable directories in the
  canonical managed LaunchAgent PATH, including user-local CLI installs.
- Replace HTTP-200-only update, restart, and in-place gates with provider
  capability verification. A missing provider bridge now fails the candidate
  switch and restores the previous runtime instead of reporting false-green.
- Target `@gotcos/glasses-server` 6.15.1 for the Kokoro Python compatibility
  fix.

## 0.2.0 (build 11)

- Add the check-only in-app update banner and signed appcast parser.
