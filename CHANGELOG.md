# Changelog

## 0.2.2 (build 13)

- Require a real, authenticated provider turn before a 6.15.2+ managed
  install, update, restart, repair, or rollback is reported as verified.
- When Kokoro reports ready, prepare speech and fetch the short-lived playback
  URL without an API header, matching the native phone audio path.
- Preserve the managed COS work folder, MCP selectors/config, compatible
  Kokoro Python overrides, and provider binary paths across runtime changes.
- Accept migrated pairing tokens with at least 16 characters and explain the
  generated 64-character format for shorter invalid values.
- Keep lifecycle locking kernel-owned and clear normal-operation PID metadata
  on unlock; a dead helper cannot leave a held lock.
- Target public server 6.15.2.

## 0.2.1 (build 12)

- Preserve discovered Claude, Codex, and Cursor executable directories in the
  canonical managed LaunchAgent PATH, including user-local CLI installs.
- Replace HTTP-200-only update, restart, and in-place gates with provider
  capability verification. A missing provider bridge now fails the candidate
  switch and restores the previous runtime instead of reporting false-green.
- Target `@gotcos/glasses-server` 6.15.1 for the Kokoro Python compatibility
  fix.

## 0.2.0 (build 11)

- Add the check-only in-app update banner and signed appcast parser.
